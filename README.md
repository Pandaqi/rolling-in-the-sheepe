# Rolling in the Sheepe

This is the source code for my game [Rolling in the Sheepe](https://pandaqi.com/rolling-in-the-sheepe). 

It was made in Godot 3.

It might be called "Sheepe" (the working title) across the codebase.

As usual, it's a local multiplayer game about being a sheep that can only _roll_ across a randomly generated track. You try to reach the finish first.
